Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the function is to generate a random index for a given list of points, with the condition that the index should not be adjacent to the previously generated index.

Inputs:
- p: a list of points

Flow:
1. If the length of the list p is less than or equal to 3, return a random index between 0 and len(p)-1.
2. Set the global variable index[2] to index[1] and index[1] to index[0].
3. Calculate the distance between index[1] and index[2] and store it in dst1.
4. Enter a while loop that generates a random index between 0 and len(p)-1.
5. Calculate the distance between the newly generated index and index[1] and store it in dst.
6. If dst1 is 0 and dst is either 1 or len(p)-1, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
7. Otherwise, break out of the loop and return the newly generated index.

Outputs:
- A random index for the given list of points.

Additional aspects:
- The function uses a global variable index to keep track of the previously generated indices.
- The function ensures that the newly generated index is not adjacent to the previously generated index.
