Code Analysis

Objective:
The objective of the init_polygon function is to initialize a regular polygon with n sides and assign colors to each vertex. The function can operate in two modes: automatic, where the vertices are calculated based on the number of sides and the size of the polygon, or manual, where the vertices are provided by the user.

Inputs:
- width: the width of the polygon
- height: the height of the polygon
- n: the number of sides of the polygon (default is 3)
- mode: the mode of operation (default is Mode.AUTOMATIC)

Flow:
1. Calculate the angle between each vertex based on the number of sides
2. Calculate the radius of the polygon based on the width
3. Initialize an empty list to store the vertices and their colors
4. For each vertex:
   a. Calculate the angle of the vertex
   b. Calculate the color of the vertex using the hsv_to_rgb function
   c. If in automatic mode, calculate the position of the vertex based on the angle and radius, and append it to the list
   d. If in manual mode, use the provided vertex position and append it to the list
   e. If mode is invalid, raise a ValueError and exit
5. Print the list of vertices and colors
6. Return the list of vertices and colors

Outputs:
- p: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the position and color of a vertex

Additional aspects:
- The function uses the math and colorsys modules, as well as the Mode enumeration from the enum module
- The function also uses the points list, which is initialized outside of the function and can be used in manual mode
- The function prints the list of vertices and colors, which can be useful for debugging purposes
- The function raises a ValueError if an invalid mode is provided, which helps ensure proper usage of the function.
