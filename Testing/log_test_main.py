Code Analysis

Objective:
The main objective of the 'main' function is to generate a chaos game fractal by iterating through a set of points and randomly selecting one to move towards, marking the pixels on a Pygame surface as it goes. It also allows for manual input of the points or automatic generation of a regular polygon.

Inputs:
- width: integer representing the width of the Pygame surface
- height: integer representing the height of the Pygame surface
- n: integer representing the number of points to use in the fractal
- r: float representing the distance to move towards the selected point
- mode: an instance of the Mode enum representing whether to use automatic or manual point generation

Flow:
1. Initialize Pygame and the surface with the given width and height, and set the caption to 'Chaos Game'.
2. If in manual mode, wait for the user to click n points on the surface and store their positions in a list.
3. If in automatic mode or after all points have been manually clicked, iterate through the points and generate a list of tuples containing the point positions and their corresponding colors.
4. While the program is running, randomly select a point from the list and move towards it by a distance of r.
5. Mark the pixel at the new position on the surface with the corresponding color.
6. If the number of iterations is a multiple of 1000, display the current iteration number on the surface.
7. If the user closes the Pygame window, save the surface as an image and quit the program.

Outputs:
- None (the function does not return anything)

Additional aspects:
- The function uses the mark_pixel function to adjust the color of a pixel on the surface.
- The random_point_index function is used to randomly select a point from the list of points.
- The Mode enum is used to represent the two modes of point generation: automatic and manual.
